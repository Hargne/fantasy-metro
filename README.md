# Fantasy Metro Game (Working Title)

## Development Guidelines

### Code

#### Indentation

To prevent unnecessary code diffs, make sure to configure Godot to use **2 spaces** for indentation: _Editor -> Editor Settings -> Text Editor -> Indent_

#### File Names & Naming Conventions

Following [Godot's Own Conventions](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/best_practices/project_organization.html), files should be named using **snake_case** and nodes named using **PascalCase**

#### Folder Structure

Keeping assets close to where it is used will make it easier to maintain the project as it grows. For this it is recommended to as far as possible make separate folders for invidual nodes and their resources.
